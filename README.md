# Qtile-Debian
This repository contains the Install script for Debian 12 (Bookworm) and later as well as the Xsessions desktop file. This script is needed for Bookworm and later, because the Debian developers decided to block the use of pip. This script unlocks pip again, so after executing it, you can use pip like you could in Bullseye and earlier.

## Note
Since the script is copying the Xsessions desktop file over to /usr/share/xsessions/, it is strongly recommended to clone the repo!
