# Qtile-Debian
This repository contains the Install script for Debian 12 (Bookworm) and later. This script is needed for Bookworm and later, because the Debian developers decided to block the use of pip. This script unlocks pip again, so after executing it, you can use pip like you could in Bullseye and earlier.
